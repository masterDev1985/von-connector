# VON Connector

Verifiable Organization Network Connector

## Getting Set Up

First, install Docker. Download the installer for your operating system [here](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community). Once it is installed, keep the Docker daemon running in the background.

Once Docker has been installed, open a terminal session and clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository url> von-connector
```

Move to the new directory:

```bash
cd von-connector
```

Now you can build the Dockerfile into an image which we will use to run containers (this process will take several minutes):

```bash
./manage build
```

Once the build process completes, you can test the build to make sure everything works properly:

```bash
./manage start_nodes
```

Once the nodes are all running and have connected to each other, you can run the Indy client to test the connection in a separate terminal window:

```bash
./manage start_client
```

The Indy CLI should boot up and you should see the following:

```
Indy-CLI (c) 2017 Evernym, Inc.
Type 'help' for more information.
Running Indy 1.1.159

indy>
```

Now connect to our new Indy network to make sure network is running correctly:

```
connect test
```

What you should see is:

```
indy> connect test

**Specifically**:

...
Connected to test.
```

If you see this, congratulations! Your nodes are running correctly and you have a connection to the network.

## Running the VON Connector

Start the Indy nodes:

```bash
./manage start_nodes
```

Once that completes, start the VON Connector in a separate terminal window:

```bash
./manage start_von_connector
```

It will first take a minute to bootstrap the environment and once that completes you should see something like this:

The VON Agent has connected to the network!

# Using the indy-dev image

I've added another docker file to make life easier for myself by building a development environment
which will let me write and run python code that uses `von-agent`.

### Building the image

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-dev -t indy-dev .
```

### Running the image

Assuming you already ran `./manage start_nodes` and the nodes are connected to the `vonconnector_default`
bridge network in docker, you can run the following command to stand up your dev environment:

```
docker run -it --net vonconnector_default -v $PWD:/root/code indy-dev bash
```
